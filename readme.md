## Installation

```sh
npm install --save react-tinder-card
```

## Usage

Import TinderCard and use the component like the snippet. Note that the component will not remove itself after swipe. If you want that behaviour implement that on the `onCardLeftScreen` callback. It is recommended to have `overflow: hidden` on your `#root` to prevent cards from being visible after they go of screen.

```js
import TinderCard from 'react-tinder-card'

// ...

const onSwipe = (direction) => {
  console.log('You swiped: ' + direction)
}

const onCardLeftScreen = (myIdentifier) => {
  console.log(myIdentifier + ' left the screen')
}

return (
  <TinderCard onSwipe={onSwipe} onCardLeftScreen={() => onCardLeftScreen('fooBar')} preventSwipe={['right', 'left']}>Hello, World!</TinderCard>
)
```

If you want more usage help check out the demo repository code: [Web](https://github.com/3DJakob/react-tinder-card-demo/tree/master/src/examples) / [Native](https://github.com/3DJakob/react-native-tinder-card-demo/tree/master/src/examples)

The simple example is the minimum code needed to get you started.

The advanced example implements a state to dynamically remove swiped elements as well as using buttons to trigger swipes.

Both Web code examples can be tested on the [demo page.](https://3djakob.github.io/react-tinder-card-demo/) The Native code examples can be cloned and runned using `expo start`.
